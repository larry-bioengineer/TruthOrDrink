# True or Drink

This is an implementation of a famous drinking game called [Truth or Drink](https://www.playtruthordrink.com/). It will be so much easier for someone to use it on the phone rather than having a deck of card. 

## Tech stack 
- Flask for creating the web app 
- Heroku for hosting the app 
- Json for storing the question list 

## Question list 
I separated the question list into PG-13 and Rated-R, and the question list came from 
- https://psycatgames.com/magazine/party-games/dirty-truth-or-dare/

## New features idea 
- add an introduction in home page on how to play 
- improve font size for mobile and PC 
- improve UI design
- adult consent (?)
- add question suggestions 
	- dynamically add to existing question database?
